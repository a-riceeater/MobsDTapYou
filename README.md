# MobsDTapYou

A requested plugin for my friend Botato.

>Create a plugin called MobsDTapYou.
(Weird name but idgaf)

Make it so every mobs attack you, but not in the way you think.
They secretly have obsidian and end crystal, so when they approach you, they basically hit crystal you.
This plugin is basically a crystal pvp practice plugin where mobs dtap you with crystals blah
